# JEP
For the very first redition of my website, i decided to use a common one pager, but in this one, it can become infinte scroll if you continue adding tables and info to the tables as well. 

I went heavy on the HTML and CSS side, since me and JQuery have some beef going on. (soon to be resolved)

I like gaming a lot, and the cyberpunk vibe is something that I thouroughly enjoy. So I started my search for a solid font. Luckily, Iceland exists. 

I NORMALY USE OPERA GX AS MY PRIMARY WEB BROWSER (ITS AWESOME BTW) AND THE ADAPTIVE BACKGROUND MUSIC IS CRAzY GOOD. SO I TRIED TO USE SOMETHING SIMILAR AND EMPLOY SOME BACKROUND MUSIC OF MY OWN. 
I READ UP ON REDDIT AND VARIOUS FORUMS, THAT HAVING AUTOPLAY IS SORT OF DISCROUAGED, SO I HAD TO ADD CONTROLS...WHICH IM NOT A FAN OF HOW IT LOOKS, SO IM TRYING TO CHANGE THAT SOON

IM A FAN OF DARK MODE, BUT I UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT, SO I ADDED THE HOVER MOUSE WITH JQUERY TO ALLOW THE USER TO CHANGE THE BACKROUND TO SOEMTHING LIGHTER (double click to GET INDIGO)

I used multiple websites to get ideas and troubleshoot (mainly JQuery and css changes)

Overall, I wanted to start with a black greeting page, where you can click on it and it takes you directly to the bulk of the general info.

I plan to keep this page updated with new features, so i added a update schedule as a header

No installation istructions needed, as this website will be live by Wednesday August 3rd. 

Unsolved problems: im having some trouble with the hide button, its mainly that i just overcooked my brain and was not able to get it solved in time. should be a quick fix just like i used the change backround-color feature with JQuery

FIXING: typos, link color to be indentifiably, pendingupdates to be fille with info

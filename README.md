# JEP
For the very first redition of my website, i decided to use a common one pager, but in this one, it can become infinte scroll if you continue adding tables and info to the tables as well. 

I went heavy on the HTML and CSS side, since me and JQuery have some beef going on. (soon to be resolved)

I like gaming a lot, and the cyberpunk vibe is something that I thouroughly enjoy. So I started my search for a solid font. Luckily, Iceland exists. 

I NORMALY USE OPERA GX AS MY PRIMARY WEB BROWSER (ITS AWESOME BTW) AND THE ADAPTIVE BACJROUND MUSIC IS CRASY GOOD. SO I TRIED TO USE SOMETHING SIMILAR AND EMPLOY SOME BACKROUND MUSIC OF MY OWN. 
I READ UP ON REDDIT AND VARIOUS FORUMS, THAT AHVING AUTPLAY IS SORT OF DISCROUAGED, SO I HAD TO ADD CONTROLS...WHICH IM NOT A FAN OF HOW IT LOOKS, SO IM TRYING TO CHANGE THAT SOON

IM A FAN OF DARK MODE, BUT I UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT, SO I ADDED THE HOVER MOUSE WITH JQUERY TO ALLOW THE USER TO CHANGE THE BACKROUND TO SOEMTHING LIGHTER (double click to get lighter gray)

I used multiple websites to get ideas and troubleshoot (mainly JQuery and css changes)
